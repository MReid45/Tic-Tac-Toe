# Tic-Tac-Toe
Small Java project demonstrating the development of artificial intelligence in games.
Developed in Spring of 2018 at Villanova University in collaboration with Mark Porowicz, Sam Cooney, and Keegan Sheedy.

The repo consists of four java files that require a compiler to launch and interact with.
The Main file allows the user to select a difficulty setting in which to play the game.
Each of the three remaining file represents varying levels of difficulty in simulating artificial intelligence in video games.
